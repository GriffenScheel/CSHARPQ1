1. A name space is something used to create to values with the same name.
2. A value type is something you use to initialize variables and to give them a certain type of value.
3. Reference types hold references to their data.
4.Used to accurately receive client input that will set objects using a get and set commmand. 
5.using helps get rid of any unwated resources.
6. The use of type dynamic is the fact that you don't need to know where the value type is coming from.
7. Used when looking at true or false statements.
8. Generic classes are classes made that hold generic information.
9. A public member class is a class where you can tap into it's members anywhere on the program.
10. Yes with the help of an Array.
11. Array.Sort() is a very useful way to sort arrays with a single primitive type.
12. Nullable's are use when value's are undefined or underlying type.
13. Helps assign a bunch of values with the same value type at the same time.
14. It allows you to create a class using past information from another class.
15. No, you can only do single inheritance.
16. Convert reference or nullable types.
17. An object is a block of memory that has been allocated and configured on the program.
18. A struct holds the same type of information together and a class can acutally do things. 
19. Break is used to get out of the current loop. Continue will just skip the certain interation of the loop.
20. Used when specifying which name is which inside your class when objects are using the same name.
21. Try and catch are used when you're trying to handle a specific problem that will cause problems whe the code is excuted.
22. Exception handling use keywords to look through a certain amount of code catch the exceptions where it didn't work and then what to do if that happens.
23. Finally is the keyword used at at the end of the exeception handling after the exceptions have been cought. This is where you choose what to finally do after finding the problem.
24. In an Array you have to set the size and you can only have one value type in the array. An Array list can have many different value types and can always get bigger.
25. I decided to skip this question because it was already asked.
26. Constructors help set defaults.
27. The compiler determines the variable type when compiling. You can use the keyword var to initialize variables at the begginging of a method.
28. An abstract class is a class that is not complete. You use this class to make subclasses.
29. An interface is a part of the program where you call on other methods or print things to the console.
30. A group of programming statements that complete a certain task. 
31. A property is a member that helps read a value of a private field.
32. Helps allow your program to know which information is accesible at different parts of your program.
33. Public's type or member can be accessed by any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it. Private's
type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class or struct. Protected type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class, or in a class that is derived from that class. Internal's type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, but not from another assembly. Protected internal's type or member can be accessed by any code in the assembly only if its declared, or from within a derived class in another assembly. Private protected's type or member can be accessed only within its declaring assembly, by code in the same class or in a type that is derived from that class.
34. Helps with grouping objects. If they are all the same type of objects you can create this collection as a generic one.
35. Holds key a value pairs to help you find what you're looking for in the class by looking up the value's key.
